# How to Generate Passive Income on SkateHive

SkateHive is a community built by skaters, for skaters. Beyond being a place to share your passion for skateboarding, it’s also a unique opportunity to generate passive income. Here, we’ll show you how to turn your participation into recurring earnings.

## What Is Passive Income on SkateHive?

On SkateHive, you can earn rewards even when you’re not actively engaged, using tools like Hive Power (HP), curation, delegation, and HBD staking. Let’s explore each of these options.

## Steps to Generate Passive Income

### 1. Create Your Account
Visit [SkateHive.app](https://skatehive.app) and sign up. Save your private keys in a secure location—they’re essential for protecting your account.  
**Important**: If you lose your keys, there’s no way to recover them, and your account will become permanently inaccessible.

### 2. Invest in Hive Power (HP)
Hive Power (HP) is used for governance, voting, and rewards. HP grows at an approximate annual percentage rate (APR) of **12.66%**.  
The APR for HIVE staking varies depending on how you use your accumulated Hive Power:
- **Staking HIVE**: Offers around **3% annually**.
- **Actively curating content**: Yields up to **10% annually**.

Hive Power is the foundation for generating passive income on the platform. The more HP you have:
- The greater the impact of your votes.
- The more you earn for curating relevant content in the community.

To increase your HP, you can convert rewards or purchase Hive (HIVE) on exchanges.

### 3. Curation: Vote and Earn
Curation means voting on posts by other skaters. When you vote for content that generates rewards, you earn a proportional share. Choose quality posts to maximize your earnings.

---

### 4. Delegate Your Hive Power
If you prefer not to curate directly, you can delegate your HP to experienced curators or trusted projects.  
Some good options include:
- Delegating to recognized curators within the SkateHive community.
- Delegating to projects like **Hive Tasks**, which facilitate reward distribution and resource management.

This ensures you earn a share of the generated rewards without active involvement.

### 5. HBD Staking: Earn 15% Annually
HBD (“Hive Backed Dollar”) is a stablecoin on the Hive blockchain.  
**HBD staking offers a 15% annual percentage rate (APR)**, meaning you’ll earn simple interest on the amount invested over a year.  

You can stake HBD directly in your Hive wallet and earn a fixed interest rate of **15% annually** (rate updated as of the creation of this document).  
This is one of the easiest and safest ways to generate passive income while contributing to the platform’s economic stability.
